''The Man and His Camel.''

Once upon a time, a poor traveling merchant named Gary came across a magical camel, Henry, at the marketplace. An interesting salesperson approached the 
merchant, begging the merchant to purchase the camel. Gary looked at the salesperson with a look of bewilderment, but he figured that if 
he wishes to experience success as a traveling merchant, he needed to have the sufficient resources to transport the goods across large distances.

The salesperson exclaimed, "Please! I will hand you this cursed camel for any price. Even a few pennies would suffice!" 

Gary never believed in curses, especially as he only believed in tangible things that he could either physcially feel or see. He continued to stare at 
the salesperson and the camel, thinking about the benefits that the camel could have for his business. In his mind, the camel became a good source of labor
that could make his business flourish. Looking down at his broken bag filled with miscellaneous items, Gary determined that purchasing the camel
was a good choice. However, he only had a single, shiny penny in his pockets. 

Gary looked at the salesperson with a sheepish smile as he spoke in a quiet tone, "I only have this penny."

The salesperson's grin spread from ear to ear, his eyes sparking with pleasure. He nodded eagerly, grabbing Gary's remaining penny. The salesperson quickly
ran away from Gary, leaving behind his now confused camel. Gary looked up at the camel and gently petted Henry's head. 

"I suppose we'll be working together now, huh?" Gary's voice was soft, highlighting his deep exhaustion and his worry about the lack of money 
he now has. His last penny was spent on this "cursed" camel. What luck. 

Gary guided Henry through the marketplace, attempting to have Henry become familiar with his presence and being in a market area, for his overall 
intentions was to utilize the camel to transport merchandise. The camel seemed to become more calm as he spent more time with Gary, but he was still a bit awkward.
After Henry's experiences with the previous owner, he began to think that he, again, would be considered a "curse" and become abandoned. 

As soon as Gary walked through the entirety of the marketplace and familiarized himself with Henry, he decided to guide Henry back to his home. Still holding the ripped
bag filled with worthless merchandise, he began to question whether his choice of buying the camel was worth it. Every penny counted, after all.
