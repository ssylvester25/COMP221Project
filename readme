Group members: Sarah Sylvester, Linh Dang, and Long Truong (COMP221: Algorithm Design and Analysis)

This project utilizes one of the algorithm topics that were covered in the course, COMP221: the Knapsack problem. We attempted to utilize this topic and apply the content that we've learned into an interesting story. Combining the story and the algorithm topic was intended to create an interesting project that outlines a situation where the Knapsack algorithm could be utilized.
