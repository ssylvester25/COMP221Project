## General Information For This Project**

This project utilizes one of the algorithm topics that were covered in the course, COMP221: the Knapsack problem. When creating this project, we became interested in finding fun applications that we could effectively utilize the Knapsack algorithm, especially as we've heard interesting ways of interpreting the algorithm, such as a robber attempting to grab as many things and putting it into their bag. In detail, we implement a more advanced version of the Knapssack algorithm. It is a variation of knapsack where a particular item can be picked up in any amount up to its capacity instead of 0 or 1 in the original 0/1 Knapsack. From that, we became inspired to create a story that stemmed from the phrase "the straw that broke the camel's back." This project is made up of two components: the text file that contains the overall story and the code that contains the Knapsack algorithm. 

With this idea in mind, we sought to create a situation where we want to place a series of items onto a camel. This camel is expected to travel across varying distances, especially as the merchant (the user) is seeking to transport the valuable items via the camel. The ``story.txt`` file outlines what the user should be aware of, making the Knapsack problem even more interesting! That way, the story could amplify the interesting and useful aspects of the algorithm. In the ``main.py`` file, the Knapsack algorithm could be found. In this file, the user can be able to see the list of items that the camel is able to hold given its capacity, which is the maximum weight that the camel could hold. 


## Running the program in VSCode
1. Ensure you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your computer.
2. Install Python Extension from VS Code Extensions tab
3. Open your Python file in VSCode by navigating to `File > Open File`.
4. **Run the File**: 
   - Locate the `main` and click the `Run` button (a small play icon) in the top right corner of the editor.
   - Click the button to execute the Python file.

Alternatively:
   - Open a terminal in VSCode (`Ctrl+`` or View > Terminal`).
   - Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` is located using `cd` commands.
   - Run the file by typing:  
     ```
     python main.py
     ```
